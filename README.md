JavaScript Design Patterns
This repository aims to provide practical and simple examples of implementing the most common design patterns in JavaScript. Each design pattern is covered in a separate directory, containing example code that illustrates its application.

Implemented Design Patterns
Singleton: The Singleton pattern is used to ensure that only one instance of a particular class exists throughout the program. In this directory, you will find an example of implementing the Singleton pattern in JavaScript.

Factory: The Factory pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object to be created. In the corresponding directory, you will find an example of how to apply the Factory pattern in JavaScript.

Observer: The Observer pattern is used to establish communication between objects, allowing one object to notify other objects about changes in its state. In the directory related to this pattern, you will find an example of implementing the Observer pattern in JavaScript.

Strategy: The Strategy pattern allows you to define a family of interchangeable algorithms and encapsulate them in separate classes. In the specific directory for this pattern, you will find a practical example of application in JavaScript.

Decorator: The Decorator pattern allows you to add additional functionalities to an existing object dynamically, without modifying its basic structure. In the corresponding directory, you will find an example of implementing the Decorator pattern in JavaScript.

MVC (Model-View-Controller): The MVC pattern is used to separate the business logic (Model), presentation (View), and user interaction (Controller) in an application. In the directory related to this pattern, you will find a simple example of application in JavaScript.

Each directory contains a README.md file explaining the design pattern, its applicability, and a practical implementation in JavaScript. Additionally, you will find detailed comments in the source code to assist in understanding and learning.

Feel free to explore the directories, examine the source code, and experiment with the provided implementations. We hope this repository helps you understand and apply design patterns in your JavaScript projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to open an issue. Enjoy learning and building!
